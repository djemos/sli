SLI (Salix-Live installer) is a GUI to install or copy the live system (based on GTK+2).
SLI-1.2.2 is based on SLI-1.1 of Slackware-Live LiNomad edition and is further developed to support user + password creation at installation time, add support for partitions creation using gparted etc.
Slackware-live is a dependency for SLI.
