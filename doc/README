SLI (Slackware-Live Sync) is a basic synchronisation utility for the 
user home directory. It is intended for backup on a remote SSH 
account and was developped for Slackware-Live LiNomad edition.

Typical LiNomad usage case:
- if the users profile and documents are stored on an USB stick, 
SLI just enables backup (and restore if data is lost); 
- if the live system is a read-only optical media, then the user can
	- restore its profile and documents at session opening,
	- and save its work before shutting down the system.
